This tool uses LIBUSB.  To force the LIBUSB driver, you must open device 
manager and select the proper USB Mass Storage Device.  Update it's driver
to the SPMP8k.inf inclosed herein.  Change the VID/PID in the inf file if
needed.

LIBUSB is an exclusive driver on windows, meaning that the disk will no 
longer be detected by windows, and the device will cease to function as a 
normal USB drive when the LIBUSB driver is installed.

In order to minimize the annoyance due to this, you should enter FW upgrade
mode before forcing the driver.  FW upgrade mode is considered a different
device, so the normal mode (media storage) can still work with windows.
